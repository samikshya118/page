    <title> Erik's Clueful HTML Brain Dump. </title>
    <p align="left">Below is just about everything you'll need to style a wordpress theme(or any other CSS-based web design).Check the source code (i.e.view source)to see the many embedded elements within paragraphs. this page is based on the wordpress Twenty Ten<FONT COLOR="BLUE"><u>HTML test page</u></FONT> . But I changed a bunch of stuff to make it more clueful (at least to me).Because I still write HTML by hand.In a text editor.so sue me. </p>
    <p align ="left"> First came <FONT COLOR="BLUE"><u>HTML</u></FONT> , and it was simple.It had content,it had format. Then came <FONT COLOR="BLUE"></FONT><u>CSS</u></FONT>,and it was not so simple. Remember when web pages used to look the same on screen and on paper ? Yeah,those days are gone.Thanks,CSS! and so content and format split,content stayed with HTML, format went with CSS. With the content / format split of  HTML/CSS,however many website designers forgot this basic rule: Website with custom Css look <u>at least</u> as good as the corresponding raw HTML   </p>
    <p align ="left"> So here are screenshots of raw HTML page, displayed in Firefox 17.0.1 under OS X 10.8.2(Mountain Lion).If you are doing any CSS based design work, then start with the look and feel of the raw HTML and improve on it , but don't leave any HTML elements out (sheesh)</p>
    <h2 align="left"> H1=Heading 1</h2>
    <p align="left"> This is a paragraph (&lt;p&gt;).IMHO,it makes sense to have vertical spacing between header elements and paragraphs</p>
    <p align="left">This is also a paragraph</p>
    <p align="left">Line 1: This is a paragraph with four lines but:</p> 
    <p align="left">Line 2:It has self-terminating</p>
    <p align="left">Line 3:line breaks (br/) at</p>
    <p align="left">Line4:the end of every line</p>
    <p align="left">You might want to use the <br/>tag for multi-line list items like this: </p>
